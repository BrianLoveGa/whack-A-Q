Just Click to 'whack' that pesky Q !

Take some anger out on that rat fiend 'Q' from a beloved show from my past now making a resurgence in pop culture.

He made a game for the Star Wars Mandalorian where you whack-a-mole but the mole is the child from the Mandalorian.

I feel there is enough violence towards children and 'aliens' in this mess of a year so after watching a re-run over lunch break of TNG I wanted to alter this attempt so we could all whack a guy that deserves it!

I could think of no-one more deserving of a few whacks than that rat fiend Q.
